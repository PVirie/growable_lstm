# growable_lstm
A collection of weak LSTMs for gradient boosting.

## Introduction
There are times when we have to deal with variable length data. And for most of those times, LSTM is the best available choice. The ability to deal with variable length data, the capacity to maintain information for an indefinite time, and the flexibility to stack more of them to form a more complex model are the core advantage that make LSTM one of the most popular algorithms even after decades of its first revelation. But it is not alone in the spotlights. Gradient boost is another algorithm that always works out of the box and has been extensively used in data competition around the world.

Here comes the thesis: can I merge the benefits of these two algorithms together into a single model? I hereby present Growable LSTM as a model that has the potential of both worlds.
